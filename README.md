**Read through the list of classes in `java.io`.  If we want to write a program to read through a text file and print the lines in it to the screen, what classes do you think might be useful?**
-BufferReader
-FileReader
-Reader
-StringReader

**From the documentation, why do we use `BufferedReader` combined with the `FileReader` class?**
-FileReader is slow by itself. When combined with BufferReader it is much faster.
